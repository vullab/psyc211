# Psyc 211: Proseminar in Computational Models of Mind

Instructor: Ed Vul

Time: Mondays 4-7pm (we will need to figure out what to do about the two monday holidays)

Location: Mandler 3545 (Crick conference room)

## Description

Computational models of perception, cognition, behavior, and social interaction formalize psychological theories, and can offer insights into both how people solve challenging everyday problems and how to improve machine performance on these problems. We will consider formalisms for sensory processing, knowledge representation, learning, planning, and decisions, with an emphasis on modeling common problem structures such as statistical learning and probabilistic inference.

## Class time

Class time will involve some lecture and discussion of readings.  Some interactive coding of a particular type of model, and some time for working on problem sets together.

## Grading

- 50% final project  
- 30% problem sets  
- 20% reading responses
